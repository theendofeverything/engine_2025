# About

Use pygame to create an application.

# Why

I started this while working with Frank Palmer on our weekly Wednesday meetups.
We decided to implement the Fourier Transform to analyze audio data. First we
thing did was record some audito data and I insisted on writing my own data
plotting application.

# Roadmap

This will eventually turn into that data plotting application. At the moment it
is still in the early stage of just getting a basic UI to build on top of.

# Math

The coordinate transforms just use high-school algebra. These will be replaced
with matrix algebra using homogenous coordinates for translation.

# Python code

The Python project follows a simple structure. The project is essentially flat
with an entry point in `main.py` and all other code residing in the `engine/` folder.

# Docs in `doc`

These docs are context for future me to remember the workflow, house-keeping
miscellany of developing a Python project.
