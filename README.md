# About

Use pygame to create an application.

Folder `engine` is my 2D engine Python package. `game.py` is a starting point
for writing a Game in the `game.py` file.

[Read the engine docs](engine/README.md) for details. Here is the essential setup step:

```
$ git clone github:theendofeverything/engine_2025.git
$ mkdir my_project && cd my_project
$ ln -rs ../engine_2025/setup.sh .
$ ./setup.sh
```
